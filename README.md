# MCMC_Supermarket
The goal of this project is to create a simulation of customer behaviour in a supermarket using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo.

# [Project: Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://github.com/spicedacademy/fenugreek-student-code/tree/karen/week_08_project)

* Created a simulation of customer behavior in a supermarket using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo methods.
* Used Pandas and NumPy for data wrangling, calculated a transition probabilities matrix, implemented a customer class, and then run a MCMC simulation for customer(s).
